   <h2>Description</h2>
   <p>The <strong>old fashioned</strong> is a cocktail made by muddling sugar with bitters and water, adding whiskey (typically rye or bourbon), and garnishing with orange slice or zest and a cocktail cherry. It is traditionally served in an old fashioned glass (also known as rocks glass), which predated the cocktail.
